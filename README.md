## Mundo Lunar

This is an "album"-concept website. The goal is to promote, well, my album, which is also called "Mundo Lunar".

I write music and produce it in Linux, with [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) as my DAW, since 2019 - the year in which I've applied and concluded a proper Home Studio course, in Rio de Janeiro. 

You're invited to access the website and of course hear the music in there. I hope you enjoy it.

As for the website's technical part, I did it with the [Wagtail Framework](https://wagtail.org/), which is a CMS built upon Django. I've tried it for the first time in this project and I've like it pretty much.

I the front-end I used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to fetch the songs' info as well as the Soundcloud player to allow for each of them to be played on the website itself.

The design's also my own, and I've used Gimp as the main tool for layout creation. This project is my first attempt in doing design since the last ten years or so.

You can access it [here](https://www.mundolunar.art.br/). It's hosted on Heroku.
