## Mundo Lunar

This is an "album"-concept website. The goal is to promote, well, my album, which is also called "Mundo Lunar".

I write music and produce it in Linux, with Ardour as my DAW, since 2019 - the year in which I've applied and concluded a proper Home Studio course, in Rio de Janeiro.

You're invited to access the site and of course hear the music in there. I hope you enjoy it.

As for the website's technical part, I did it with the Wagtail Framework, which is a CMS built upon Django. I've tried it for the first time in this project and I've like it pretty much.

I the front-end I used Vue.js to fetch the songs' info as well as the Soundcloud player to make possible for each of them to be played on the website itself.
